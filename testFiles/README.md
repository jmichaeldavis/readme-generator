## Description <a name="description"></a>
This application allows the user to create a custom read-me file and automatically generates it in Markdown formatting. This is all done through the use of inquirer, an npm package.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To use this, the user must do 'npm i' to install the packages, then run 'node index.js' to have inquirer start up in the integrated terminal. Node.js must be installed for this to work.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Carly Staheli and I worked on this entire project together. We are married and collaborated on it primarily just using her computer while casting it to a TV. Because of this, my commit history is nearly non-existant.
